# 🔧 CSV Import Download Link Fix - COMPLETE

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

### **❌ Previous Issue**
Test 7 (CSV Import) was not providing download links because the detection condition only matched `"Successfully created"` messages, but CSV import returns `"Successfully converted CSV to Excel"`.

### **✅ Fix Applied**

**Changed detection condition from:**
```python
if "Successfully created" in text and ".xlsx" in text:
```

**To:**
```python
if "Successfully" in text and ".xlsx" in text:
```

---

## 🎯 **All Success Messages Now Covered**

### **✅ Enhanced Detection Pattern**
The fix now catches ALL Excel file operations:

1. **create_excel_file**: `"Successfully created Excel file: {filename}"` ✅
2. **import_csv_to_excel**: `"Successfully converted CSV to Excel: {filename}"` ✅
3. **create_excel_chart**: `"Successfully added {chart_type} chart '{title}' to {filename}"` ✅
4. **format_excel_cells**: `"Successfully applied formatting to {cell_range} in {filename}"` ✅
5. **export_excel_to_csv**: `"Successfully exported Excel to CSV: {filename}"` *(CSV export, no .xlsx)*
