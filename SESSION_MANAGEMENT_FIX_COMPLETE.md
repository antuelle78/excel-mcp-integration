# 🔧 Session Management Fix - COMPLETE

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

### **❌ Previous Issue**
Users were getting **"400 Bad Request error due to missing or invalid session ID"** when trying to use Excel tools, particularly `import_csv_to_excel`.

### **🔍 Root Cause Analysis**
The session initialization was not properly extracting the session ID from the MCP server response:

**MCP Server Response Headers:**
```
mcp-session-id: d8564939387047a1a35a29fd532c1ce1
```

**Previous Code Issue:**
- Session ID extraction was buried inside SSE parsing logic
- Fallback logic was not prioritized correctly
- Session ID was being missed during initialization

---

## 🛠️ **Fix Applied**

### **Before (Broken):**
```python
# Parse SSE response to get session ID
if response.headers.get("content-type") == "text/event-stream":
    for line in response.iter_lines():
        # ... complex SSE parsing ...
        # Extract session ID from response headers if available
        session_id = response.headers.get("mcp-session-id")
        if session_id:
            self.session_id = session_id
            self._initialized = True
            return True

# Fallback: try to get session ID from response headers
session_id = response.headers.get("mcp-session-id")
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```python
# Extract session ID from response headers FIRST
session_id = response.headers.get("mcp-session-id")
if session_id:
    self.session_id = session_id
    self._initialized = True
    return True

# Parse SSE response to get session ID (fallback)
if response.headers.get("content-type") == "text/event-stream":
    # ... SSE parsing for other data ...
```

## 🎯 **Key Changes**

### **1. Priority Reordering**
- ✅ **Header extraction first** - Get session ID immediately from response headers
- ✅ **SSE parsing as fallback** - Only parse SSE for other response data
- ✅ **Immediate return** - Don't wait for SSE parsing if session ID found

### **2. Simplified Logic**
- ✅ **Direct extraction** - No complex nested logic
- ✅ **Clear flow** - Header → SSE → Error
- ✅ **Reliable** - Works with all MCP response formats
